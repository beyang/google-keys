# Keyboard navigation for Google Search

* Adds keyboard navigation of results that Google Search used to have (tab, up/down arrows, enter to
  visit link).
* Adds Ctrl+Shift+v shortcut to Gmail to open links to GitHub issues (opens the last link found on
  the page) and Sourcegraph code discussions.
* Steals existing tab instead of fresh page load (if the existing tab exists).
